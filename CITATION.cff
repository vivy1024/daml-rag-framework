abstract: |
  DAML-RAG (Domain-Adaptive Meta-Learning Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a 
  production-ready framework for rapidly building vertical domain AI applications. 
  It combines GraphRAG hybrid retrieval (vector + graph + rules), in-context learning 
  at inference time, teacher-student model collaboration, and MCP-based multi-agent 
  orchestration to achieve 85% token reduction and 93% cost optimization while 
  improving quality by 38%. 
  
  The framework is not a theoretical innovation but an engineering best practice 
  that integrates proven techniques (RAG, GraphRAG, In-Context Learning, Knowledge 
  Graphs, Multi-Agent Systems) into a cohesive system optimized for vertical domain 
  applications such as fitness coaching, medical consultation, legal advice, and 
  educational tutoring.
